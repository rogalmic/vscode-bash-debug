# bashdb-part2.sh - bashdb specific code that doesn't need preprocessor

# First it helps separate code that undergoes m4 substitution and second
# it keeps line number the same more often in integration tests because
# this code changes more often making code bashdb.in code change less.
# It is the line numbers in that code that appear in tracebacks.
