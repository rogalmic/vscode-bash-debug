_Dbg_help_add display \
"**display** [*stmt*]

Evalute *stmt* each time the debugger is stopped. If *stmt* is omitted, evaluate
all of the display statements that are active. In contrast, **info display**
shows the display statements without evaluating them.

Examples:
---------

  display echo \$x  # show the current value of x each time debugger stops
  display          # evaluate all display statements

See also:
---------

**undisplay** and **info display**."

# Set display command or list all current display expressions

  if (( 0 == $# )); then

    _Dbg_disp_enable[$n]=1
