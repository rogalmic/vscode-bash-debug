_Dbg_help_add eval \
'**eval** *cmd*

**eval**

**eval?**

In the first form *cmd* is a string *cmd* is a string sent to special
shell builtin eval.

In the second form, use evaluate the current source line text.

Often when one is stopped at the line of the first part of an "if",
"elif", "case", "return", "while" compound statement or an assignment
statement, one wants to eval is just the expression portion.  For
this, use eval?. Actually, any alias that ends in ? which is aliased
to eval will do thie same thing.
