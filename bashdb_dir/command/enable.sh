_Dbg_help_add enable \
'**enable** *bpnum1* [*bpnum2* ...]

Enables breakpoints *bpnum1*, *bpnum2*... Breakpoints numbers are
given as a space-separated list of numbers.
With no subcommand, breakpoints are enabled until you command otherwise.
This is used to cancel the effect of the "disable" command.
