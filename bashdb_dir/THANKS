Some ideas from Kent Sibilev's ruby-debug have been encorporated into
this debugger. 

The O'Reilly book on the Korn shell by Bill Rosenblatt suggested that
it might be possible to write a debugger.

Thanks to Chet Ramey for continued support of bash and
adding/encorprating changes needed to support debugging better.
