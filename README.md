# Overview
This is a SIMPLE bashdb debugger frontend. Useful for learning bash shell usage and writing simple scripts.

Useful hint: shellcheck extension does a great job with finding common script errors before debugging.

## Usage
1. Select **Debug -> Start Debugging (F5)** to start debugging (if launch.json is not available, it will be created with default configuration)
2. Select **Debug -> Add Configuration** to add custom debug configuration (drop-down, path-input, etc...)

See https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging for general usage.

For Windows users:
1. Install [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux)

For macOS users:
1. Read [here](https://github.com/rogalmic/vscode-bash-debug/wiki/macOS:-avoid-use-of--usr-local-bin-pkill) if your mac has `/usr/local/bin/pkill`.

## Dependencies
1. `bash 4.3` or `bash 4.4`
2. `cat`, `mkfifo`, `rm`, `pkill`

## Limitations and known problems
* For now, the debugger supports **only non-interactive scripts** (no stdin, limited [workaround](https://github.com/rogalmic/vscode-bash-debug/wiki/workaround-for-stdin) for this exists)
* Watch variables should be specified with $ at the beginning (this expression is evaluated in bash - for example `${#PWD}` returns path length)
* Currently debugger stops at first command, also `$0` variable shows path to bashdb.
